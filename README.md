### 1. K-Means

K-Means is a clustering algorithm used in machine learning techniques. K-Means algorithm is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised learning. Substantially, K-Means algorithm tries to group similar points in the form of <strong>clusters</strong>. In K-Means algorithm, the number of groups in problem is represented by the <strong>K value</strong>.
